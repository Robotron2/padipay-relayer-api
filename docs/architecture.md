# Relayer Architecture

The PadiPay Stellar Relayer API employs the "Relayer" or "Fee Bump" pattern.

## The Relayer Pattern

In a decentralized system designed for everyday users (Web2.5), expecting users to hold native blockchain tokens (like XLM) to pay for transaction fees creates immense friction.

Instead, the Relayer API handles this:
1. **Request Reception**: The WhatsApp bot sends an authenticated HTTP request to the Relayer containing the user's intent.
2. **Transaction Construction**: The Relayer constructs the Soroban contract invocation transaction.
3. **Fee Sponsoring**: The Relayer uses a backend-held account (the "Fee Bump Account") to sign the transaction, explicitly agreeing to pay the network fees on behalf of the user.
4. **Network Submission**: The fully signed transaction is submitted to the Stellar network via a Horizon or RPC node.
5. **Status Polling**: The Relayer monitors the transaction and returns the finalized status to the bot.

This ensures PadiPay users can interact with smart contracts seamlessly via WhatsApp without ever needing a crypto wallet.
