# PadiPay Stellar Relayer API Roadmap

> Living roadmap for the **PadiPay Stellar Relayer API**.
>
> This document outlines the project's current progress, upcoming milestones, and future contributor opportunities. It should evolve alongside the project as milestones are completed.



# Vision

The PadiPay Stellar Relayer API exists to abstract blockchain complexity from end users.

Its long-term goal is to provide a secure, reliable, and scalable middleware layer that enables Web2 applications such as the PadiPay Web Portal and WhatsApp Bot to interact with Soroban smart contracts without requiring users to understand wallets, XLM fees, or transaction construction.

The relayer is responsible for delivering a seamless gasless transaction experience while remaining modular, secure, and easy to extend.

# Definition of Success

The project reaches **v0.1.0** when:

* The API starts successfully.
* Incoming requests are validated.
* Soroban transactions can be constructed.
* Fee bump transactions are created successfully.
* Transactions are submitted to Stellar Testnet.
* Transaction status can be queried.
* Tests pass successfully.
* Documentation is complete.
* CI passes successfully.


# Guiding Principles

As the project evolves, we aim to:

* Keep pull requests small and reviewable.
* Maintain a modular service architecture.
* Separate routing from business logic.
* Prioritize security.
* Write comprehensive tests.
* Build incrementally without overengineering.
* Welcome community contributions through well-defined GitHub Issues.


*Last Updated: v0.1.0 Development*
